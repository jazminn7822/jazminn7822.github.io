            <h5>Background:</h5>
            <p>
                This project was designed for us to demonstrate our knowledge of HTML and CSS. These past couple of months we have learned Basic Web Design for HTML and CSS, and now our task was to recreate a website of your choice by using our abilites in the Basic Web Design field. I decided to recreate the <a href=" https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank"> apple.com </a> website. For me this was quite a challenge since I didn't quite recall how to properly use div elements, so I didn’t really know where to begin in the process of my project. I made a plan of what I would have to learn on my own on specific days. After reviewing my notes and going to websites like <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/ " target="_blank"> freecodecamp.org </a> and <a href= " https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank"> w3schools.com</a>, I remembered how to position elements or images I needed to include in the website. As I recreated my website, something I was really stuck on was portraying the apple logo on the top left corner and the search and shopping bag logo on the top right corner of the apple website. I looked at a variety of examples, but I just wasn’t able to get it to work. I knew I had to use div elements, but I wasn't able to figure out how to properly place them and should've spent more time learning this on my own. Eventhough I faced multiple challenges, I was able to achieve my MVP (Minimum Viable Product) which I wasn’t too upset with because it had the main content which for me was the most important. Eventhough I have submitted my project in already, I still want to figure out what part of the HTML and CSS I was missing in my code to get the small logos on the top left and right cornes of the apple website. </p>
